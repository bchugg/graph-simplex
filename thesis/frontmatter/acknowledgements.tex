Having recently read A.J. Jacobs' \emph{Thanks a  Thousand} and  being of persuadable character, I am inclined to search out and thank everyone who has helped with this thesis and made my time at Oxford so extraordinary. 

This, of course, would be a terrible idea. Where would I stop? There are far too many forces which contribute to  a thesis---not  all of them wholesome

Indeed, aside from all the wonderful people  and ideas  with which one  finds themselves surrounded in Oxford,  I  would have also have to acknowledge some of the oddities  ... 
Alas, resigned to the fact  that I must commit a kind of thanksism  and draw  an arbitrary line between those I thank and  those I don't, I do wish to extend  my gratitude to several  people. 

Thanks is due to Renaud, who unflinchingly allowed an all-too-enthusiastic masters student to pursue his topic of choice, and follow any . The freedom to pursue whatever  I found interesting was  greatly appreciated. I also owe a great  deal of thanks to Karel,  who provided insight into the topic which I would  have never  garnered  by myself, and who  was  always willing to answer my (incessant) questions. 

This year would not have been one tenth as exciting (albeit perhaps ten times as productive) without the St. Cross student community and the Wolfson College Boat Club. Though small in quadrangle count (it's  how you use them  that counts), St. Cross provided a friendly and stimulating environment. One has not  known  bliss until one has tasted yogurt  at St. Cross lunch---which by itself redeems the odd smell in the library that nobody wants to talk about. 
WCBC ensured that I caught many crabs, lengthened  my strokes, and perfected my hip swing. Sometimes I even rowed. Although ... I could not have  asked for a  better group of people  with whom to be trapped in  a boat early in the morning, being yelled at about pineapples and early squares. 

My parents provide a constant source of support and encouragement for which I am  incredibly  grateful. 

Much love.
