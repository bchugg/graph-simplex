Aside from simply torturing undergraduates with contrived calculus questions, mathematicians a

A central focus of mathematical  research is, of course, to further develop its different branches---geometry, topology (the study of continuous deformations of geometric objects), analysis (the underpinnings of calculus), number theory for example. Another concern  is to seek connections between these different areas. Such  connections are elusive, but often point to some deeper and beautiful (stay with me) mathematical structure. For example, 

This dissertation is concerned with research of the latter type. In  the 1990s, Miroslav Fiedler began exploring what we are calling the ``graph-simplex correspondence''. A graph is a purely ...
A simplex is essentially a triangle, but generalized  to higher dimensions. Is it therefore inherently geometric, which makes the connections between graphs and simplices all the more surprising. We summarize and expand on Fiedler's research. 

When studying the abstract, one can never be  sure where whether one's work will remain only of interest to mathematicians or will find some application. That being said, we expect this research to be highly applicable---it will most likely help develop interstellar travel, clarify broad macroeconomic trends, and 6G. Just kidding. 

We do hope, however, that this work will shed light on an interesting connection which will inspire future research.
