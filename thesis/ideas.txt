\section{Ideas and TODOs}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Next sections to think more about: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Inequalities (Section \ref{sec:inequalities}) 
		\item Low Rank Approximations of $\L_G$ (Section \ref{sec:algorithmics_low_rank})
		\item Could include more of Fiedler's results in Section \ref{sec:block_matrix}. Also should see if we can obtain  similar results vis-a-vis the normalized simplex . 
		\item Keep thinking about the normalized simplex. 
	\end{enumerate}
\item Most promising new ideas: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Use algorithms and known results concerning effective results and translate them to simplex results. 
\end{enumerate}
\item Less promising new ideas: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  In ~\cite{fiedler1998some}, Fielder gives some sort of correspondence involving ``ultrametric matrices''. Look this up and understand it---could be interesting. 
	\item Applications of Schur Complement? 
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
